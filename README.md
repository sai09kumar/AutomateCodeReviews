# Automating Code Reviews with Amazon CodeGuru

# Lab Description
When you submit a pull request to a CodeGuru-associated code repository, such as Amazon CodeCommit, CodeGuru will peruse the changes in the pull request and make recommendations based on its own analysis of millions of lines of external code, as comments on your file changes. Additionally, if you deploy CodeGuru as an agent in your application, over time it will make observations and recommendations to help you find and fix code issues such as performance leaks, wasted CPU cycles and more.

# Learning Objectives
1. Be familiar with the basics of Amazon CodeGuru
2. Use CodeGuru to analyze code in a repository

# Prerequisites
1. Familiarity with the AWS console is helpful but not required
